# #ViralKindness

## Only spread kindness to your neighbours

In order to contain [the COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) it's important to practice social distancing.
But this means that there are many people who may not be able to go and get necessary supplies.

As neighbours we can help each other!

1. Wash your hands
2. Print 6 copies of [these cards](/card/v1)
3. Drop into your neighbour's letterbox; 1 completed copy and 5 empty copies for redistribution
